# Quickstarts

This is a collection of the original sims used for the quickstarts available in OD as they were prior to the start of Round 20.

The majority were procedurally generated to hit specific landsizes based on input conditions. Any additions to the sims were for automation and export purposes and have not changed the functionality of the sim.

Always remember to use the latest version of the sim when making your own.
