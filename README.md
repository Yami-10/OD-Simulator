# OD-Simulator

OpenDominion Simulator for sprint round and round 46. The OpenDominion Simulator utilizes tables and requires Excel 2010 or later. Check it and let us know what you think on Discord! Always remember to check which version you're using and report any bugs.

Update: The sim is now fully functional on macOS

Beginning in round 46, the sim has undergone changes to mirror our new protection rules. Protection is now 48 ticks long, down from 72. You can set your initial, instantaneous construction directly on the Overview page.
